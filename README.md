# flutter_anim

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

Hello, I have not used my boiler plate code for this task, used local state management for this. But I know how to use mvc pattern, bloc architecture etc.
For now quickly completing the task as I am busy with other works. So if any doubts then let me know, I can explain the whole thing.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
